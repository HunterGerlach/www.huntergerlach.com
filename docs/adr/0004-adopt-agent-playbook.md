# ADR 0004: Adopt Agent Playbook Framework

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

AI-assisted development sessions on this repo had no durable guidance — each session started from scratch with no consistent standards for testing, security, commit style, or workflow. The [agent-playbook](https://github.com/HunterGerlach/agent-playbook) repo provides a universal, portable instruction set for AI coding agents.

## Decision

Integrate the agent-playbook framework:

- `AGENTS.md` at repo root — bootstrap stub with prime protocol, non-interactive safety rules, session completion checklist.
- `CLAUDE.md` symlinked to `AGENTS.md` — Claude Code compatibility.
- `.agent/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` — full universal engineering standards (operating protocol, TDD, security, git discipline).
- `.agent/AGENTS.override.md` — project-specific Jekyll context, conventions, and quality gates.
- `Makefile` — canonical `build`, `serve`, `test`, `check-links` targets.

Support files live in `.agent/` to keep the root clean. Only the bootstrap stub and symlink remain at root.

## Consequences

- **Consistent AI sessions** — every agent reads the same standards on startup.
- **No AI fingerprints** — per playbook policy, no Co-Authored-By trailers or "generated by" annotations.
- **Quality gates defined** — `make test` runs Jekyll build + html-proofer validation.
- **Maintenance cost** — must manually sync `.agent/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` when the upstream playbook updates.
- **Small root footprint** — only 2 files added to root (AGENTS.md + CLAUDE.md symlink).
