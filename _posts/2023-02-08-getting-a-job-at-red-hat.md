If you're interested in joining Red Hat, you're not alone. Many people have asked for advice on how to get a job at the company. This post will guide you through the process, with a focus on joining Red Hat as a consultant. However, the steps outlined here will be applicable for most roles within the company.

## Research the Company

Before applying for a job, take the time to research Red Hat and its culture. Start by reading about the company's values, mission, and products. Look for information about the work environment to see if it's a good fit for you. Read employee reviews and feedback online to get a better understanding of what it's like to work at Red Hat. Keep in mind that Red Hat has a strong and unique culture, so it's important to determine if it's a good fit for you before you apply.

## Connect with Red Hat Employees

Reaching out to local Red Hat employees can provide valuable advice and guidance. Attend industry events and conferences where Red Hat employees might be present, and connect with them on LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, or other professional networks. Ask for referrals or introductions from your existing network. The goal should absolutely not be to secure a job through these connections, but rather to build a relationship and learn more about working at Red Hat.

## The Scenario

After your research and interactions, you're now sure you want to join Red Hat. Let's start with the scenario to help you navigate the next few steps: At your current company, you are in a role that allows you to get exposure to Red Hat products. You find the idea of working with these products daily compelling. You also love sharing your knowledge with people, so you think a role in Consulting will be a good fit. Not only that, but you have been in your current role for a while, so you think the role of Senior Consultant is where you would fit in. Alright, now we can dig in.

## Find the Right Role

Take a look at the <a href="https://jobs.redhat.com" alt="job listings on Red Hat website">available jobs on Red Hat's website</a> and review a few of them. Make sure to find the role that best fits your background, abilities, and area of interest. Some roles may be more focused on AppDev, while others may be more focused on the platform engineering and infrastructure side of the house.

## Identify the Right Part of the Organization

Once you have a good understanding of the type of consulting role that best fits your background, abilities, and interests, it's time to determine which part of the organization would be the best fit for you. There are different teams within Red Hat that support different types of customers. For example, there is a team that supports public sector customers (NAPS, the North American Public Sector group) like the Department of Defense and many well-known public service providers. On the other hand, there are consultants who support commercial customers (NACOM, North America Commercial) such as healthcare providers, banks, telecommunications companies, and other well-known brands.

## Search for the Right Job Posting

After identifying which part of the organization you are best suited, you can then start searching for the specific job posting that matches your skills and experience. The job postings available on Red Hat's website usually provide a clear description of the expectations and responsibilities of each role. Make sure to read a few of these postings to get a better understanding of the types of roles available and to find one that best fits your needs.

## Update Your Resume and Cover Letter

Once you've found a role (or roles) you would be a good candidate for, it's time to apply. This should go without saying, but you need to ensure that your resume and cover letter (assuming it is needed) are up-to-date and that they accurately reflect your relevant skills and experience. Tailor your cover letter to the specific role you are applying for and emphasize your passion for Red Hat's products and culture. Highlighting your relevant experience and qualifications will increase your chances of standing out to hiring managers and getting hired.

## Apply for the Job

Once you've updated your resume and cover letter, it's time to apply for the job. Red Hat's application process is straightforward and easy to navigate. You can apply for a job by clicking on the "Apply Now" button on the job posting. You will be asked to create an account and upload your resume and cover letter. You will also be asked to answer a few questions about your background and experience. Once you've completed the application, you will receive an email confirmation. If you are a good fit for the role, you will be contacted by a Red Hat recruiter to schedule an interview.

If you know someone at Red Hat, you can ask them to refer you for the role. This could increase your chances of getting hired. Even if it doesn't increase your changes, it still allows the referring employee to help you with the application process, track your submission status, and to provide you with valuable feedback.

## Prepare for the Interview Process

Getting hired at Red Hat requires not only a strong application but also a successful interview. It's essential to prepare for the interview process by researching common interview questions and practicing your answers in advance. You don't need to wear a suit and tie, but dress professionally. Red Hat is generally relaxed about clothes as it's more important that you know your way around the technology, but it's still important to make a good first impression. During the interview, make sure your enthusiasm for the company and interest in the role are clear. Ask thoughtful questions about the role and the company to demonstrate your interest and more importantly to get a better understanding of what it's like to work at Red Hat. This is your chance to learn directly from the people who work there, so make the most of it.

## Stay Active and Connected

If you are not hired right away, don't get discouraged. Keep practicing your interview skills and networking. Stay in touch with your Red Hat contact and ask for feedback on your application. Keep working towards your goal and eventually, you will get there. In the meantime, consider taking courses or attending workshops related to Red Hat's products and services to further your knowledge and skills. Stay up-to-date on the latest industry developments and participate in online forums or discussion groups to network with other professionals in the field. Obtain certifications and other credentials to demonstrate your expertise and increase your chances of getting hired. You should also consider volunteering for open source projects to gain valuable experience and build your resume.

## Maintain Relationships

Finally, it's important to maintain genuine relationships with your Red Hat contacts. Consider connecting with them on LinkedIn or reaching out to them periodically to offer help and to check in and see if there are any new opportunities that would be a good fit for your skills and experience. By maintaining these relationships, you will not only increase your chances of being hired at Red Hat, but you will also have a strong network for when you are inevitably hired on to Red Hat.

Good luck with your job search!
