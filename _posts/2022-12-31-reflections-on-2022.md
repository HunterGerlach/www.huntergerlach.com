2022 was a year of personal and professional growth for me.

In addition to welcoming my third child into the world, I also had the opportunity to work on the VCS Collection System, a project that was a huge accomplishment for myself and my team. The VCS Collection System required tons of man hours to complete, but it allowed us to learn so much in such a short period of time â€“ both about technology and about ourselves.

We spent two years building and supporting multiple systems to help customers safely return to the office at the end of the pandemic. On top of that, we open sourced the VCS Collection System in accordance with our values, making the code freely available to the public.

In a future blog post, I will go into more detail about the VCS Collection System and the challenges and triumphs we faced while working on it.

One of the highlights of the year for me actually happened relatively recently with the rise of ChatGPT, which broke the internet. Likewise, it has consumed much of my time since. It has been an exciting and challenging experience learning about this new technology, and I have enjoyed figuring out how to use it effectively in my everyday life.

Moreover, I have enjoyed finding and contributing to the LangChain community. LangChain is an open source LLM python library. I stumbled upon the project while building an application and had just overcome a technical hurdle. It was frustrating at first because I felt like it had been wasted time, but I realized that it helped me better understand the library from the start. My contributions to-date have been relatively small, but it's been fun watching the community grow and solve problems day in and day out. I plan to continue contributing in the foreseeable future.

As I look ahead to the new year, I am excited to continue building on the progress I have made in terms of personal goals. I have been focusing on building technical depth and consistency, and I am proud of the progress I have made. In 2023, I hope to see even more progress in these areas, as well as continue building strong relationships in my open source communities.

To ring in the new year, I will be keeping things low-key with family. Thank you for reading my blog post. If you have any comments or questions, please find me on Twitter. I would love to hear from you! Here's to a successful and fulfilling 2023!
