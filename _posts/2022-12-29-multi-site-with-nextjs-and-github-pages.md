# Deploying a Next.JS Application to Multiple Stages with GitHub Pages and Actions

Are you looking for a way to deploy your Next.JS application to multiple stages or environments, such as staging and production? In this blog post, I'll show you how to use GitHub Pages and Actions to set up a multi-stage deployment process for your Next.JS application.

## Setting up GitHub Pages for the Staging Environment

GitHub Pages is a free hosting service that allows you to publish static websites directly from a GitHub repository (provided you follow their generous terms of service). You can use GitHub Pages to host your Next.JS application in the staging environment by pushing your code changes to the `main` branch of a repository.

To set up GitHub Pages for the staging environment, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository for your Next.JS application.
2. Add the code for your Next.JS application to the repository.
3. Go to the settings page for the repository and enable GitHub Pages for the `main` branch.
4. Configure any necessary details, such as the URL of the staging environment.
5. Push your code changes to the `main` branch of the repository. The application will be automatically deployed to the staging environment by GitHub Pages.

## Setting up GitHub Actions for the Production Environment

GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate your workflow and build, test, and deploy your applications. You can use GitHub Actions to set up a workflow that deploys your Next.JS application to the production environment when you create a new release and tag it with the desired version number.

To set up GitHub Actions for the production environment, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository for your GitHub Actions workflow.
2. Add the code and configuration for the workflow to the repository.
3. Configure any necessary details, such as the URL of the production environment.
4. Create a new release of your Next.JS application and tag it with the desired version number. The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy the application to the production environment.

## Conclusion

By using GitHub Pages and Actions, you can easily set up a multi-stage deployment process for your Next.JS application. Whether you're deploying to staging or production, these tools make it easy to automate your workflow and ensure that your application is always up-to-date.
